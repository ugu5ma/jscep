=== Actors ===

  # Requester or Client
  # CA

=== Steps ===

  # Requester sents *GetCACert* message to SCEP URL
  # Either CA or RA responds with single DER-encoded X.509 certificate DER-encoded 'degenerate' PKCS#7 SignedData message with an X.509 certificate chain (CA -> RA)
  # Requester checks if CA certificate is trusted by prompting user with message digest of X.509 certificate
  # Requester constructs a PKCS#10 certificate signing request (CSR)
  # Requester constructs a PKCS#7 SignedData object with it's RSA private key, and includes its self-signed certificate.
  # Requester uses the dataEncipherment RA to construct an EnvelopedData object.
