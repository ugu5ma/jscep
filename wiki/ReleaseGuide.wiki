#summary How to do a release

{{{
mvn release:prepare
}}}

Enter the new version numbers.  Defaults are usually fine.  You will then be prompted for the password for your GPG key.  If everything goes fine, then do:

{{{
mvn release:perform
}}}

Otherwise, do:

{{{
mvn release:rollback
}}}

When the release has been performed and the artifacts have been deployed to Sonatype, check out the new release tag, then do

{{{
mvn clean package source:jar javadoc:jar
}}}

Upload the source, javadoc and jar artifacts for api, client and server.
