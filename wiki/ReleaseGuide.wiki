#summary How to do a release
#labels Phase-Support

{{{
mvn release:prepare
}}}

Enter the new version numbers.  Defaults are usually fine.  You will then be prompted for the password for your GPG key.  If everything goes fine, then do:

{{{
mvn release:perform
}}}

Otherwise, do:

{{{
mvn release:rollback
}}}

When the release has been performed and the artifacts have been deployed to Sonatype, check out the new release tag, then do in each of api, client and server.

{{{
mvn clean install source:jar javadoc:jar com.googlecode.maven-gcu-plugin:maven-gcu-plugin:1.0:upload
}}}

Upload the source, javadoc and jar artifacts for api, client and server.
